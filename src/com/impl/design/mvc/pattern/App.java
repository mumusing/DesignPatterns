	 *  -Model: represents an object or a class carrying data.
	 *           It can also have logic to update controller if its data change 
	 *           
	 *           
	 *  -Controller: acts on both model and view
	 *  It controls the data flow into model objects
	 *     and updates the view when ever data changes
	 *     It keeps view and model separate
	 *     
	 *  -View: represents the visualization of the data that model contains
	 *      MODEL  <--->  CONTROLLER  <----> VIEW
